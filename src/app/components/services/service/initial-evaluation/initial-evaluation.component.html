      A structured clinical interview is performed initially, prior to any recommended
      psychological treatment. Many types of data are collected including medical,
      psychological, and family history in addition to neuropsychological screening for
      a variety of cognitive disorders. A tentative psychiatric multi-axial diagnosis is

      Evaluation results are presented at the end of the hour and discussed with the
      patient. Individuals are encouraged to provide additional information and
      opinions regarding their information. HIPPA guidelines and office policies are
      explained, and signatures for consent to treatment are obtained. Frequently a
      schedule for therapeutic visits is discussed and established.
